# Educational Agent Frameworks

This repository is created **strictly for educational purposes**. It serves as a learning sandbox to explore, implement, and understand various agent frameworks and architectures using large language models (LLMs) and related AI systems.

## Goals

The primary objective of this repository is to gain hands-on experience with the following agent-based approaches:

- **Reflection System** – agents that self-critique and iteratively improve.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Agents** – workflows involving human feedback or oversight.
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration** – systems where multiple specialized agents interact.
- **ReAct Agent** – reasoning and acting agents that interleave thought and tool use.
- **RAG Agent** – Retrieval-Augmented Generation agents for grounding responses in external knowledge.
- **Reflexion System** – advanced variants of reflection with enhanced memory or strategy modules.

Feel free to use, modify, and contribute to this repo as part of your learning journey in agentic LLM systems.
